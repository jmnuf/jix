Local first-ish note taking web app, still a WIP.

Scaffolded from vite react template.

## Aim
This project aims to be a sem-local-first app that is cheap to deploy and relatively easy for me to use. Why pay for a syncing note taking app when I write massively simple notes virtually and I could just host it on the free tier of some stuff.

Things I want to do (this list doesn't reflect what will be made):
- [x] Basic Markdown rendering
- [x] Interactive checkboxes in markdown view mode
- [ ] Encrypt note content, note name, and notebook name
- [ ] Turn into a PWA
- [ ] Backup data in some Database
  - [ ] When offline wait till back online to send changes to DB
  - [ ] Possibly handle conflict resolution
- [ ] Be able to load data from Database
- [ ] Custom editing modes
  - [ ] Vi mode
  - [ ] Emacs mode
  - [ ] Ed mode
- [ ] Desktop build!
  - [ ] Re-create part of the UI in some native language (C, Rust, or Go, IDK rn)
  - [ ] Save/Load locally the notes
  - [ ] Sync with server
- [ ] If I finish that one other project, port this to use that thing
